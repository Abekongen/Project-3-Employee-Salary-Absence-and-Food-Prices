## Dataset
The dataset includes key variables related to employees' salaries, absences, and food prices, comprising:
- **Salary ($):** Recorded salaries of employees.
- **Absences (days):** The number of days employees were absent.
- **Food Price ($):** Prices categorized as High, Medium, or Low.

## Methodology

### 2.1 Ask
The key questions driving this analysis include:
- How does absence correlate with average salaries?
- What is the average food price across different levels of employee absences?
- How do food prices relate to salary categories?

### 2.2 Prepare
The preparation phase involved:
- Collecting the relevant dataset and verifying its accuracy.
- Cleaning the data to remove any inconsistencies or errors.
- Structuring the data for easy analysis.

### 2.3 Process
Data processing steps included:
- Aggregating salary and food prices by absence levels.
- Analyzing food prices to determine their average based on absence levels.

### 2.4 Analyze
The analysis involved:
- **Bar Charts:** Comparing the average salary against the number of absences.
- **Scatter Plots:** Exploring relationships between salary and absences.
- **Bar Charts for Food Prices:** Analyzing average food prices by absence levels and comparing them with salaries.

### 2.5 Act
Based on the analysis, recommendations include:
- Implementing strategies to reduce employee absences, as these directly impact salary levels and overall productivity.
- Monitoring food prices to ensure they align with employee salary levels, facilitating better budgeting for employee welfare programs.

## Findings / What We Discovered
- **Salary vs. Absences:** There is a clear negative correlation between the number of absences and average salary. Employees with more absences tend to have lower average salaries, suggesting that absence may influence performance assessments and salary increases.
- **Absences and Food Prices:** The average food price remains relatively stable across different levels of absences. This indicates that food pricing may not be significantly affected by employee attendance patterns.
- **Salaries by Food Price Category:** The analysis reveals that employees categorized under high food prices have the highest average salaries (63K), while employees in the low food price category have the lowest average salaries (61K). This suggests a potential relationship between salary levels and food accessibility.
- **Food Price Distribution:** Over 53% of the total food prices fall into the low category, indicating that a majority of employees may be more accustomed to lower food costs, which could impact their discretionary spending.
- **Trends in Absences:** Employees with fewer absences (1-5 days) show a trend towards higher salaries than those with more extensive absence records. This reinforces the idea that maintaining consistent attendance is linked to better financial outcomes for employees.

## Limitations
- The dataset may not account for all factors influencing salary and absence relationships, such as job performance or external economic conditions.
- Self-reported data on absences may introduce inaccuracies.
- The analysis is limited to aggregate data and may overlook individual variations within demographic groups.

## Conclusion
This report highlights key insights from the analysis of employee salary, absence, and food price data. It underscores the importance of monitoring employee attendance and food pricing strategies in supporting employee welfare. By addressing identified patterns, organizations can work towards enhancing employee productivity and satisfaction while managing associated costs effectively. Future studies may benefit from a more granular approach, incorporating additional variables to deepen the understanding of these dynamics.
